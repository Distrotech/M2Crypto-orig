See \r\nLICENCE for details.\r\n\r\nTo install, see the file INSTALL.\r\n\r\nLook at the tests and demos for example use. Recommended reading before\r\ndeploying in production is \"Network Security with OpenSSL\" by John Viega,\r\nMatt Messier and Pravir Chandra, ISBN 059600270X.\r\n\r\nNote these caveats:\r\n\r\n- Possible memory leaks, because some objects need to be freed on the\r\n  Python side and other objects on the C side, and these may change\r\n  between OpenSSL versions. (Multiple free's lead to crashes very\r\n  quickly, so these should be relatively rare.)\r\n    \r\n- No memory locking/clearing for keys, passphrases, etc. because AFAIK\r\n  Python does not provide the features needed. On the C (OpenSSL) side\r\n  things are cleared when the Python objects are deleted.\r\n    \r\n\r\nHave fun! Your feedback is welcome.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
